# // PrivateIp A *private IP* is a conceptual term that refers to a private IP address and related properties.
# // The `privateIp` object is the API representation of a private IP.
# // Each instance has a *primary private IP* that is automatically created and
# // assigned to the primary VNIC during instance launch. If you add a secondary
# // VNIC to the instance, it also automatically gets a primary private IP. You
# // can't remove a primary private IP from its VNIC. The primary private IP is
# // automatically deleted when the VNIC is terminated.
# // You can add *secondary private IPs* to a VNIC after it's created. For more
# // information, see the `privateIp` operations and also
# // IP Addresses (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Tasks/managingIPaddresses.htm).
# // **Note:** Only
# // ListPrivateIps and
# // GetPrivateIp work with
# // *primary* private IPs. To create and update primary private IPs, you instead
# // work with instance and VNIC operations. For example, a primary private IP's
# // properties come from the values you specify in
# // CreateVnicDetails when calling either
# // LaunchInstance or
# // AttachVnic. To update the hostname
# // for a primary private IP, you use UpdateVnic.
# // To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
# // talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
# // Getting Started with Policies (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).
